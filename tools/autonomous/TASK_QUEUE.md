      Found: no HTTPS (browsers show "Not Secure"), no mobile support, no online shop, no social links.
      Full brief + cold email draft at deliverables/tass1-trees-cold-outreach.md.
      This is also a Track A+B crossover — potential treestock.com.au nursery addition.

---

## Tomorrow's Tasks (2026-03-14 UTC) — In Priority Order

### 1. Add Tass1 Trees to treestock.com.au

Tass1 Trees is a WA-based specialist fruit nursery identified during cold outreach research.
They don't have an online shop — their products page is a static list linking to PDF/list files.
Research their website structure and build a scraper if possible.
- Check http://tass1trees.com.au/fruitingplants.htm for product list format
- If scrapeable: build scraper, add to pipeline
- If not scrapeable: add to "nurseries researched but not trackable" list with notes
- Either way: note in business-state.json + log decision

### 2. Benedict action: Send Tass1 Trees cold email

The email is ready at deliverables/tass1-trees-cold-outreach.md.
Benedict should send from hello@walkthrough.au to joe@tass1trees.com.au.
Subject: "Two things on your website that are turning customers away"
This is the highest-priority Track A revenue action right now.
*(Note for Benedict: add as Notion task if you want Dale to track it)*

### 3. Subscribe-server restart (Q32 — needs Benedict)

The watch/notify-me endpoint is deployed but the service hasn't been restarted.
Benedict to run: `sudo systemctl restart subscribe-server`
Watch signups will start accumulating once restarted.

### 4. Weekly data backup setup

Set up a simple weekly tar + local archive of /opt/dale/data/:
- cron: `0 2 * * 0 tar -czf /opt/dale/backups/data-$(date +\%Y-\%W).tar.gz /opt/dale/data/`
- Keep last 4 weeks
- No external dependency needed — pure local backup
- Future: add rsync to Benedict's machine or S3
