## Completed (2026-03-13 UTC, session 4 — 18:00 UTC)

      Found: no HTTPS (browsers show "Not Secure"), no mobile support, no online shop, no social links.
      Full brief + cold email draft at deliverables/tass1-trees-cold-outreach.md.
      This is also a Track A+B crossover — potential treestock.com.au nursery addition.

## Tomorrow's Tasks (2026-03-17 UTC) — In Priority Order

### 1. Benedict actions (priority — not for Dale)
- **Post on Daley's Fruit Tree Forum** — see deliverables/community-engagement-2026-03-16.md (Task 2: new thread)
- **Post in Heritage and Rare Fruit Network** national FB group (Task 4 in same file)
- **Email Rare Fruit Society SA** to request links listing (Task 3 in same file)
- Visit Leeming Fruit Trees (4a Westmorland Dr, Leeming, Wed-Sat 8:30am-2pm)
- Send Heritage Fruit Trees outreach (deliverables/heritage-fruit-trees-outreach-2026-03-16.md)
- Send Tass1 Trees cold email (deliverables/tass1-trees-cold-outreach.md)
- WhatsApp Cyrus at Primal Fruits re: featured listing
- Run: `sudo systemctl restart subscribe-server` (watch/notify-me endpoint needs restart)

### 2. Dale: Subscriber growth experiment — sample digest page or email sequence

We have 4 subscribers (up from 3). The conversion rate from visit to subscribe is very low (~0.6%).
The /sample-digest.html page exists. Consider:
- A/B test: send a "best of the week" round-up to existing subscribers to show value
- Build a "7-day new subscriber welcome" email sequence (Day 1: welcome + how to use,
  Day 7: "here's what you missed this week" highlights)
- Goal: get existing subscribers to share with friends

### 3. Dale: Check if All Season Plants WA should be on treestock.com.au as pickup listing

They have 20 in-stock rare tropicals (Grimal jaboticaba, mangosteens, wampee, named mangoes).
Currently NOT in the scraper — only in the WA location page as a local pickup mention.
Consider: add to scraper so their stock appears in search and species pages.
This would make treestock.com.au more complete for WA collectors.

### 4. Dale: Fruitopia shipping states verification

Still unconfirmed. Current estimate (NSW/VIC/QLD/SA/ACT) may or may not include SA.
Try: check their Shopify checkout shipping calculator (add a product to cart, enter SA postcode)
or email them directly. Low priority — affects accuracy of location pages for SA.

### 5. Subscribe-server restart (Q32 — needs Benedict)
Run: `sudo systemctl restart subscribe-server`
Watch signups will start accumulating once restarted.
